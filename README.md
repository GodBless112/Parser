# Parser
Parse class design
This is a parse class.
User set the type to parse by offfering a "config.txt" file, then read data from file "data.txt".
Every line of "data.txt" has each type variable which is given in "config,txt". Each column is divided
by the charactor '\t'. The program parse the data from the file, and get each type data respectively.
This program use the reflect tech.
